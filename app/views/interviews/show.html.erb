    <h1>Founders Aboard!</h1>

    <p>
      Hi, <%= @interview.first_name %>!
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m Anton, co-founder and editor-in-chief at <%= link_to 'CloudChart', root_path %>. We’re building a <strong>global platform for founder education</strong>. We’re on a mission to kickstart and help the global entrepreneurial community outside Silicon Valley. We believe it’s a noble goal, and <strong>we ask for your advice</strong>.

      You were referred by <%= mail_to @interview.ref_email, @interview.ref_name %><%= @interview.whosaid %>. I would like about <strong>30 minutes of your time</strong> to interview you about <%= @interview.company_name %>’s story, to integrate it into a <strong>study resource for founders</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The material I am working on analyses how successful startups came to life, and <strong>highlights a timeline</strong> of major milestones in your company's growth. My goal is to build a <strong>collection of 'stories'</strong> and process it into a very visual and
      informative guide for founders. Not a case study in a traditional sense, but a very personal look at how your company has come to life.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here’s a sketch of our ‘Company Timeline’ tool that we’re building at CloudChart:

      We’d also like to share that we already have several other founder tools <strong>ready for our pre-launch</strong>:

        <div class="description">
          An orgcharting tool in the cloud, best in its class (it’s a promise). <%= link_to 'Want to try it out?', '#' %>

      <div class="burn-rate">

        <div class="description">
          A burn rate tool that is closely tied to our org. charts and presents your data in a visual way.

    <p>
      I’m from Russia; I’ve been involved in <strong>tech journalism</strong> and <strong>futures studies</strong> for over <strong>8 years</strong>. I contributed a bimonthly tech/futurology column to Prime Russian, one of Moscow’s leading art, culture and futures studies printed publications. I also co-ran Thalient, a product development and consulting company from Moscow that worked with Intel and other companies on in-car and hyperlocation-based user experiences.
    </p>

    <p>
      I co-founded CloudChart and moved to SF Bay Area because I see a <strong>tremendous shortage</strong> of concise smart materials illustrating the growth of early-stage companies. I am working on a resource that will turn a short-lived story in an article into a <strong>solid resource for wantrepreneurs and other founders</strong>. With any luck, you will find it very useful, too.

    <h1>This Is How You Can Help</h1>

    <p>
      <%= @interview.first_name %>, If you’re based somewhere in SF Bay Area, or visiting, I’d be delighted to meet you personally for a coffee or lunch — preferably at your office or a coworking space. Otherwise, a Skype call or a Hangout will work as well! I only ask for about 30 minutes of your time.
